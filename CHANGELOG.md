# Changelog

* Boosted search results for every entity using cited by count. Documents with higher cited by count are more
likely to be shown first. [2021-01-11]
* Any query parameter or field can be written as hyphenated or underscore. 
So `group_by=publication_year` and `group-by=publication-year` will work the same. [2021-01-10]
